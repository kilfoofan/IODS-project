## Logistic regression

Arto Vesterbacka

This chapter is about logistic regression using student data.

### Setting up libraries and working directory.

```{r Libraries}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
#library(GGally)
```

```{r Working directory}
setwd("C:/koulu/mooc/intro to open data/IODS-project/") # change this if you wish to run the code on your computer
```

### Loading the data

```{r Data Loading}
dta_mat <- read.csv("student-mat.csv", sep=";", header=TRUE)
dta_por <- read.csv("student-por.csv", sep=";", header=TRUE)
dim(dta_mat)
dim(dta_por)
str(dta_mat)
str(dta_por)
```

### Joining the two dataset

Joining the two dataset with only the students present in both sets

```{r Joining the datasets}
join_by <- c("school","sex","age","address","famsize","Pstatus","Medu","Fedu","Mjob","Fjob","reason","nursery","internet")
mat <- inner_join(dta_mat, dta_por, by = join_by)
dim(mat)
str(mat)
```
